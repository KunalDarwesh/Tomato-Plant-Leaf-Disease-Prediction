# Tomato-Plant-Leaf-Disease-Prediction
In the agriculture sector, one of the major problems in the plants is its diseases. The plant diseases can be caused by various factors such as viruses, bacteria, fungus etc. Most of the farmers are unaware of such diseases. That's why the detection of various diseases of plants is very essential to prevent the damages that it can make to the plants itself as well as to the farmers and the whole agriculture ecosystem.Regarding this practical issues, this project aimed to classify and detect the plant's diseases automatically especially for the tomato plant.Image processing is the key process of the project which includes image acquisition, adjusting image ROI, feature extraction and Transfer Learning Techniques like Inception V3 and Resnet50 based classification. Here, Python programming language, OPENCV, Tensorflow, Keras library is used to manipulate raw input image.Demo for this project is already uploaded with file name as Tomato Disease classification Demo.mp4
